Water quality and its management play a crucial role in maintaining the well-being of indigenous communities. Indigenous and Secondary Education communities often lack access to real-time water quality data, hindering their ability to make informed decisions about water resources. This Waterra project aims to address this issue by providing an accessible and user-friendly platform for visualizing and understanding water quality data from various sources and integrating cultural and historical information related to water features and land areas. The name of our project, Waterra, combines the morphemes of both the words ‘water’ and ‘terra’, which can be interpreted as the water of the earth.
